* Tasks 
** DONE finish getListOfMessages() 
** DONE Get decodeMessage() to add to messages.csv
** DONE Get index.html to print the message list
** TODO Make it a bit prettier
*** TODO Print messages in a table


* Notes
- messages.csv will use a semicolon as a delimiter, this means that in the webpage, the message will need to be checked to see if it contains semicolons
